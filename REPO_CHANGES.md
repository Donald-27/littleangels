  - Minimum record counts for all tables
  - Data relationships (students→parents, routes→vehicles)
  - QR code generation
  - Cross-dashboard consistency
  - Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure

---

## 4. Environment Configuration

### Backup Created
- **File:** `.env.bak` (if .env exists)
- **File:** `.env.local.bak` (if .env.local exists)
- **Purpose:** Safety backup before modifications

### Supabase Configuration
- **Confirmed credentials:**
  - URL: `https://zvkfuljxidxtuqrmquso.supabase.co`
  - Anon Key: [configured]
  - Service Role Key: [configured]
- **Location:** `config/supabase-config.js` (with fallbacks)

---

## 5. Code Quality Improvements

### Line Ending Fixes
- **File:** `src/pages/admin/Settings.jsx`
- **Action:** Converted Windows (CRLF) to Unix (LF) line endings
- **Tool:** `dos2unix` / `sed` conversion

### Import Cleanup
- Removed unused icon imports across multiple files
- Standardized import patterns
- Fixed circular dependencies

---

## 6. Real-time Integration

### Supabase Realtime Configuration
- **Events per second:** Limited to 10 (optimized)
