You are an automated full-stack engineer with access to the entire repository in this Replit workspace. Do not stop until the entire web app is fully integrated, consistent across dashboards, seeded with realistic initial data, tested, and ready to deploy. Work iteratively and autonomously: scan, fix, test, seed, verify, repeat. Commit every safe change with clear messages and push to a new branch called fix/integrate-and-seed (do NOT force-push the default branch). Create a short changelog of every high-level change you make.

High level goals

Automatically detect the project stack(s) (frontend, backend, frameworks) and how to run them locally. If you cannot detect, assume standard stacks (React/Vite or CRA frontend, Node/Express or Flask backend).

Ensure all features are integrated so actions on one dashboard reflect immediately and correctly on other dashboards (student add/update/delete, transport updates, notifications, reports, staff changes, etc.).

Fix broken imports, unused files, inconsistent state management, and any runtime errors that block the app.

Ensure proper authentication/authorization flow (JWT or Supabase session): logins work for admin/teacher/parent/driver and access controls are correct.

Connect the frontend and backend real-time flows (use Supabase real-time, websockets, or polling) so cross-dashboard updates reflect quickly.

Detect Supabase usage and read the DB structure from any existing SQL, migrations, or the .env/supabase config. If a Supabase project is referenced, use existing schema files to generate seeds that match the tables.

Seed realistic test data (students, parents, staff, drivers, vehicles, routes, notifications, sample reports). The app must programmatically verify that seeded data is visible throughout relevant dashboards and functionality.

Improve the app where obvious: address UX issues, make forms validate, add missing fields (email/phone), add better error handling and clear user messages.

Provide a final readiness checklist and exact commands to run, build, and deploy.

Step-by-step instructions (do these automatically, do not ask for permission)
A. Repo analysis

Recursively scan all files to detect frontend (React/Vue/etc), backend (Flask/Express/Django/etc), database setup, environment files, and package managers (npm/yarn/pip).

Produce a single text file REPO_ANALYSIS.md describing detected stack, start/run commands, ports used, location of key files (auth, DB config, main components for dashboards), and any missing run scripts.

B. Safe workspace preparation

Create and switch to new git branch fix/integrate-and-seed.

Back up any env files or assets you will modify (copy .env.local or .env to .env.local.bak but DO NOT print sensitive secrets).

Run linters/builds/tests available in repo; capture errors.

C. Fix integration & runtime issues

Fix all import/export errors and missing named exports.

Fix React runtime errors, missing icons/components, or broken routes.

Standardize authentication flow: if Supabase is used, ensure src/lib/supabase (or equivalent) is the single source of truth and all pages use it. If JWT backend exists, ensure frontend uses correct token storage and refresh logic.

Ensure dashboards share a single source of truth for entities using one of: global state (Context/Redux/Recoil), or real-time listeners (Supabase subscriptions / socket.io). If multiple disconnected copies of state exist (e.g., separate fetches with differing behaviors), refactor to a shared hook or service (e.g., useStudents()).

Implement or fix real-time updates: add Supabase on() listeners or socket events so when a student/transport/staff is added/updated/deleted, all dashboards update in < 2s.

Add missing fields that are referenced in context (email, phone). Default to 'N/A' when optional and present them in UI and PDF generator outputs if present.

D. Database & seeds

Locate Supabase config or schema files (SQL, migrations). If a supabase folder or migrations exist, use them. If not, inspect code to infer table names/columns (e.g., students, staff, transport, notifications).

Create a scripts/seed_supabase.sql or scripts/seed_supabase.js (or Python script) that seeds:

6 students (with name, email, phone, class, guardian id)

4 parents/guardians

3 teachers

2 drivers, 2 vehicles, 3 routes

5 sample notifications

3 sample reports

Also create a scripts/verify_seed.js script that queries the DB (via Supabase client or direct DB connection) and asserts the presence of seeded rows, returning nonzero exit on failure.

If secrets are needed to run seeds, instruct exactly which env values to set (e.g., SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY) in README_SEEDING.md.

E. Automated tests & verification

Add basic end-to-end or integration checks (these can be simple Node scripts that use HTTP requests or Supabase queries):

Create student via API or UI endpoint and confirm it appears in the students table and visible in admin/parent/teacher/driver dashboards (via API endpoints or by checking the same shared state).

Update a student and confirm the change is reflected across dashboards.

Delete a student and confirm removal across dashboards.

Create a notification and confirm it's visible in the notifications component.

Run these verification scripts after seeding and failing fast if any check fails. Repeat fixes until all pass.

F. Improvements & features

Add server-side validation and meaningful error messages.

Improve forms to prevent invalid input (client and server).

If no email/phone in forms, add them and ensure they save to DB and display in dashboards.

If the doctor note / PDF generators exist, ensure signature and watermarks behave; include email in PDF footer if present.

Suggest and implement at least 2 small UX improvements (clearer dashboard filters, search box, or sort; better error toasts; responsive mobile layout fixes).

G. Commit, document, deliver

Commit every change with clear messages, push branch to remote.

Generate DEPLOY_READY.md with:

exact commands to run dev and production builds,

ports and env variables required,

how to seed DB and run verification,

CI/CD suggestions (e.g., GitHub Actions file example) and how to deploy to Vercel/Render/Heroku.

Produce a summary READY_CHECKLIST.md of acceptance criteria with PASS/FAIL for each item.

Acceptance criteria â€” stop only when all are PASS

App builds without runtime errors in dev mode for both frontend and backend (if present).

Authentication works for admin/teacher/parent/driver roles.

Adding/updating/deleting a student via any dashboard is reflected in all dashboards within 2 seconds (via real-time update or consistent API/state).

Seed script runs and verify_seed passes.

All automated verification scripts pass.

No console errors in browser devtools on the main dashboard.

Documented commands for running, seeding, verifying, and deploying are provided.

Code is committed to branch fix/integrate-and-seed and pushed.

Strict rules for you (do not deviate)

Do not reveal secrets or print .env content. If you need secrets to run seeds, write Set SUPABASE_URL=... and SUPABASE_KEY=... but do not include their values.

Back up env files before editing.

Commit changes to fix/integrate-and-seed. Never force push to main.

If you detect destructive changes that would overwrite significant remote commits, stop and create a patch branch instead, then report what you found in REPO_ANALYSIS.md.

If you cannot automatically fix something after 3 attempts, list the remaining blockers in BLOCKERS.md with reproducible steps and exact error messages.

Output required in the repository when finished (at minimum)

A pushed git branch fix/integrate-and-seed with commits showing stepwise fixes.

Start now. First produce REPO_ANALYSIS.md and the initial commit on fix/integrate-and-seed. Proceed without asking for clarification. Work until the readiness checklist is fully satisfied.
