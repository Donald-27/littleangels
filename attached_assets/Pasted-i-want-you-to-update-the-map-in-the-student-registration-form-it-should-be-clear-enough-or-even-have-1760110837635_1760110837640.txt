i want you to update the map in the student registration form it should be clear enough or even have the real buildings so parents can choose their locations or homes on the map accurately and also update the drivers dashboard such that when a driver wants to head out to his assigned route the app should be able to alert the parent when the bus is within 800 metre from the location that has been saved when registering the student this means that the driver is assigned a specific route by the admin or headteacher such tht when the driver wants to head out he or she clicks on a button to activate which make the app active and should also be able to allow headteacher see when the bus is heading ut or heading in, the driver also selects whether it is dropping student sor when it is going to pick them.go then to teachers dashboard wherebby the teacher will be abke to click when they get to school meaning when they sign in and the app should verify based on the location of the teacher and the location of the school accurate to 30 metres and the app should be able to automatically verify and allso the teacher should be able to sign out when heading out and the admin should be able to see all this and know when teacher signs in or out.another thing the driver should have an option to see the students within the area he or she is on the route he has been given and be able to manuallly send an automated message ro the parent in the area or when the driver arrives at thelocation and there is no student.teachers should be able to chat or discuss some things with the parents directly or in something like a group groups sshould be formed as per the classes of the teachers and the teacher and one of the parents is an admin and the admins have some priviledges i the app make the chatting functionality real fully functional admin should also be able to send a message to the teacher or staff or parents it should be able to look and function like whatsapp. on the teachers dashboard the should be a featue allowing the teacher to post or save the results of the learner and when posted it should be able to reflect on the parents dashboard with some cool features such as graphs or analytics whch should be able t compare results of the previous results, this should be comprehensive, the admin should also be able to see the results of the student when he clicks on the students dashboard meaning the admin must have a feature to check every student and their info and change some info when necesarry.the admin must have a functionl feature to alert or send message or notification this one already exists but not fully functionally there should be a staff dashboard with as many features as possible just lik other dashboards this is for cooks watchman and any other staff meaning ythe admin when registering should clearly mention if the person is staff or driver or teacher.here are the supabse info you will need anonpublic

Project URL https://zvkfuljxidxtuqrmquso.supabase.co .. i wan you also on the admin dashboard to have a feature which allows the admin choose the location of the school this will help in other dashboads eg the drivers dashboard and staff and teachers when thy sign in to the school.admin can also update the school motto and vision and an image of their flag make them visible and reflect in other dashboards or even the home page of the school or login page.the app should be able to generate result slips as well which will be posted to the parents the admin also will map out the routes of the buses using real map and this feature should be able to help map out theroutes as well but the admin himself be able to click on the routes and assign specific bus with their number plate and driver this means the admin has the ability to change route or driver name or bus. now work on all this ideas i have asked you to work on and dont stop until you are sure you have worked on all of them and that all of them are fully functional,dont make any incomplete or have anything hardcoded but rather make it work fully, make everything as comprehensive and for each dashboard you can add some more features maybe 1 2 or 3 features very cool and unique.for anything i migh have forgotten make sure to work on it i know i wont be able to mention all of themi want you to update the map in
