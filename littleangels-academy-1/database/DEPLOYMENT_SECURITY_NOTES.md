# Database Security & Deployment Notes

## Current State: Development Environment

### RLS Policies
- **Current**: Permissive policies for development testing
- **Production**: Role-based policies documented in `production_rls_policies.sql`

### Security Status
| Component | Development | Production Ready |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Database Schema | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Ready |
| CASCADE Rules | ‚úÖ Implemented | ‚úÖ Ready |
| Currency Settings | ‚úÖ KES Default | ‚úÖ Ready |
| Multi-guardian Support | ‚úÖ Implemented | ‚úÖ Ready |
| RLS Policies | ‚ö†Ô∏è Permissive | üìã Documented |

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Replace Development RLS Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Remove permissive development policies
   DROP POLICY "Allow all access for development" ON users;
   
   -- Apply production policies from production_rls_policies.sql
   \i database/production_rls_policies.sql
   ```

2. **Verify auth.uid() Availability**
   - Ensure Supabase auth system is properly configured
   - Test auth.uid() function returns correct user IDs
   - Verify JWT token handling works

3. **Test Role-Based Access**
   - Create test users for each role (admin, teacher, parent, driver, accounts)
   - Verify each role can only access appropriate data
   - Test all CRUD operations per role

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Enable SSL/TLS for all database connections
   - Configure connection pooling with proper limits
   - Set up database monitoring and logging
   - Review and test all RLS policies thoroughly

5. **Update Environment Settings**
   ```sql
   UPDATE settings 
   SET value = '{"environment": "production", "rls_policies": "enforced", "production_ready": true}'
   WHERE key = 'deployment_environment';
   ```

### Role-Based Access Summary

- **Admin**: Full access to all data within their school
- **Teacher**: View students, attendance, incidents for their school
- **Parent**: View only their children's data (students, payments, tracking, etc.)
- **Driver**: Update vehicle tracking, create boarding logs for assigned vehicles
- **Accounts**: Manage payments and financial data

### Critical Security Features

1. **Multi-Guardian Support**: Students can have multiple guardians with proper relationship tracking
2. **Vehicle Assignment Control**: Drivers can only access data for their assigned vehicles
3. **School Data Isolation**: Users can only access data from their assigned school
4. **Parent-Child Relationship Enforcement**: Parents can only see their own children's data
5. **Audit Trail**: All critical operations logged with timestamps and user attribution

## Development vs Production

- **Development**: Uses permissive RLS policies for easier testing
- **Production**: Enforces strict role-based access controls
- **Migration Path**: Well-documented procedure to upgrade from development to production security model

This approach allows for efficient development while ensuring production deployment will be secure and compliant with data protection requirements.
